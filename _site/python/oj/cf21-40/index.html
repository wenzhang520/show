  <h5>关于Sample Test样式的问题</h5>
  <p>目前我是直接用的pygments bash类型来对test进行处理，实际上我觉得input和output如果能带上颜色，那么会更直观一些。</p>
  <p>如果有人对<a href="http://pygments.org/" target=_blank>Hacking For Pygments</a>感兴趣，可以试着增加对input和output的过滤识别并上色，或者也可以试着尝试一下pygments支持的哪种语言可以对其上色。</p>

<h1>110A Nearly Lucky Number</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all numbers are lucky. Petya calls a number nearly lucky if the number of lucky digits in it is a lucky number. He wonders whether number n is a nearly lucky number.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The only line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10**18).

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print on the single line "YES" if n is a nearly lucky number. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first sample there are 3 lucky digits (first one and last two), so the answer is "NO".<br>
In the second sample there are 7 lucky digits, 7 is lucky number, so the answer is "YES".<br>
In the third sample there are no lucky digits, so the answer is "NO".

<h1>236A Boy or Girl</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.</p>

<p>But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.</p>

<p>This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in "wjmzbmr". These characters are: "w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r". So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print "CHAT WITH HER!".

<h1>339A Helpful Maths</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Xenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.</p>

<p>The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.</p>

<p>You've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters "+". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String s is at most 100 characters long.
<br>

<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the new sum that Xenia can count.

<h1>144A Arrival of the General</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>A Ministry for Defense sent a general to inspect the Super Secret Military Squad under the command of the Colonel SuperDuper. Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all n squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.</p>

<p>By the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.</p>

<p>For example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.</p>

<p>Within one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers. Help him count the minimum time needed to form a line-up which the general will consider correct.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first input line contains the only integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) which represents the number of soldiers in the line. The second line contains integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) the values of the soldiers' heights in the order of soldiers' heights' increasing in the order from the beginning of the line to its end. The numbers are space-separated. Numbers a1, a2, ..., an are not necessarily different.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the only integer — the minimum number of seconds the colonel will need to form a line-up the general will like.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first sample the colonel will need to swap the first and second soldier and then the third and fourth soldier. That will take 2 seconds. The resulting position of the soldiers is (44, 33, 22, 11).
<br><br>
In the second sample the colonel may swap the soldiers in the following sequence:
<br><br>
(10, 10, 58, 31, 63, 40, 76)<br>
(10, 58, 10, 31, 63, 40, 76)<br>

<h1>266B Queue at the School</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>During the break the schoolchildren, boys and girls, formed a queue of n people in the canteen. Initially the children stood in the order they entered the canteen. However, after a while the boys started feeling awkward for standing in front of the girls in the queue and they started letting the girls move forward each second.</p>

<p>Let's describe the process more precisely. Let's say that the positions in the queue are sequentially numbered by integers from 1 to n, at that the person in the position number 1 is served first. Then, if at time x a boy stands on the i-th position and a girl stands on the (i + 1)-th position, then at time x + 1 the i-th position will have a girl and the (i + 1)-th position will have a boy. The time is given in seconds.</p>

<p>You've got the initial position of the children, at the initial moment of time. Determine the way the queue is going to look after t seconds.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n, t ≤ 50), which represent the number of children in the queue and the time after which the queue will transform into the arrangement you need to find.
<br><br>
The next line contains string s, which represents the schoolchildren's initial arrangement. If the i-th position in the queue contains a boy, then the i-th character of string s equals "B", otherwise the i-th character equals "G".
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print string a, which describes the arrangement after t seconds. If the i-th position has a boy after the needed time, then the i-th character a must equal "B", otherwise it must equal "G".

<h1>271A Beautiful Year</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.</p>
<p>Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.</p>
<strong>Input</strong><br>
The single line contains integer y (1000 ≤ y ≤ 9000) — the year number.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>

<h1>136A Presents</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Little Petya very much likes gifts. Recently he has received a new laptop as a New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody else as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts. And on this occasion he organized a New Year party at his place and invited n his friends there.</p>

<p>If there's one thing Petya likes more that receiving gifts, that's watching others giving gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year and made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts while he does not participate in the process. He numbered all his friends with integers from 1 to n. Petya remembered that a friend number i gave a gift to a friend number pi. He also remembered that each of his friends received exactly one gift.</p>

<p>Now Petya wants to know for each friend i the number of a friend who has given him a gift.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the quantity of friends Petya invited to the party. The second line contains n space-separated integers: the i-th number is pi — the number of a friend who gave a gift to friend number i. It is guaranteed that each friend received exactly one gift. It is possible that some friends do not share Petya's ideas of giving gifts to somebody else. Those friends gave the gifts to themselves.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print n space-separated integers: the i-th number should equal the number of the friend who gave a gift to friend number i.

<h1>268A Games</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.</p>

<p>There are n teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of n·(n - 1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.</p>

<p>You know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number. Help Manao find the answer to his question.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contains a pair of distinct space-separated integers hi, ai (1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100) — the colors of the i-th team's home and guest uniforms, respectively.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
In a single line print the number of games where the host team is going to play in the guest uniform.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first test case the championship consists of 6 games. The only game with the event in question is the game between teams 2 and 1 on the stadium of team 2.
<br><br>
In the second test sample the host team will have to wear guest uniform in the games between teams: 1 and 2, 2 and 1, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 2 (the host team is written first).

<h1>263A Beautiful Matrix</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>You've got a 5 × 5 matrix, consisting of 24 zeroes and a single number one. Let's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from top to bottom, let's index the matrix columns by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one move, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the matrix:</p>

1. Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with indexes i and i + 1 for some integer i (1 ≤ i < 5).<br>
2. Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that is, columns with indexes j and j + 1 for some integer j (1 ≤ j < 5).

<p>You think that a matrix looks beautiful, if the single number one of the matrix is located in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third row and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.</p>
<strong>Input</strong><br>
The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers: the j-th integer in the i-th line of the input represents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. It is guaranteed that the matrix consists of 24 zeroes and a single number one.
<br>

<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

<h1>122A Lucky Division</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.</p>
<p>Petya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given number n is almost lucky.</p>
<strong>Input</strong><br>
The single line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number that needs to be checked.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
In the only line print "YES" (without the quotes), if number n is almost lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
Note that all lucky numbers are almost lucky as any number is evenly divisible by itself.In the first sample 47 is a lucky number. In the second sample 16 is divisible by 4.

<p>In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The i-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the i-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the i-th digit of the answer is 0.</p>

<p>Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.</p>

<p>Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Write one line — the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.

<h1>237A Free Cash</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Valera runs a 24/7 fast food cafe. He magically learned that next day n people will visit his cafe. For each person we know the arrival time: the i-th person comes exactly at hi hours mi minutes. The cafe spends less than a minute to serve each client, but if a client comes in and sees that there is no free cash, than he doesn't want to wait and leaves the cafe immediately.</p>

<p>Valera is very greedy, so he wants to serve all n customers next day (and get more profit). However, for that he needs to ensure that at each moment of time the number of working cashes is no less than the number of clients in the cafe.</p>

<p>Help Valera count the minimum number of cashes to work at his cafe next day, so that they can serve all visitors.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10**5), that is the number of cafe visitors.
<br><br>
Each of the following n lines has two space-separated integers hi and mi (0 ≤ hi ≤ 23; 0 ≤ mi ≤ 59), representing the time when the i-th person comes into the cafe.
<br><br>
Note that the time is given in the chronological order. All time is given within one 24-hour period.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print a single integer — the minimum number of cashes, needed to serve all clients next day.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first sample it is not enough one cash to serve all clients, because two visitors will come into cafe in 8:10. Therefore, if there will be one cash in cafe, then one customer will be served by it, and another one will not wait and will go away.
<br><br>
In the second sample all visitors will come in different times, so it will be enough one cash.

<h1>69A Young Physicist</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>A guy named Vasya attends the final grade of a high school. One day Vasya decided to watch a match of his favorite hockey team. And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. "Piece of cake" — thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), then follow n lines containing three integers each: the xi coordinate, the yi coordinate and the zi coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body ( - 100 ≤ xi, yi, zi ≤ 100).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if it is not.

<h1>141A Amusing Joke</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>So, the New Year holidays are over. Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two "New Year and Christmas Men" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.</p>

<p>The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.</p>

<p>Help the "New Year and Christmas Men" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print "YES" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the "New Year and Christmas Men". Otherwise, print "NO" without the quotes.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.
<br><br>
In the second sample letter "P" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter "L".
<br><br>
In the third sample there's an extra letter "L".

<h1>268B Buttons</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Manao is trying to open a rather challenging lock. The lock has n buttons on it and to open it, you should press the buttons in a certain order to open the lock. When you push some button, it either stays pressed into the lock (that means that you've guessed correctly and pushed the button that goes next in the sequence), or all pressed buttons return to the initial position. When all buttons are pressed into the lock at once, the lock opens.</p>

<p>Consider an example with three buttons. Let's say that the opening sequence is: {2, 3, 1}. If you first press buttons 1 or 3, the buttons unpress immediately. If you first press button 2, it stays pressed. If you press 1 after 2, all buttons unpress. If you press 3 after 2, buttons 3 and 2 stay pressed. As soon as you've got two pressed buttons, you only need to press button 1 to open the lock.</p>

<p>Manao doesn't know the opening sequence. But he is really smart and he is going to act in the optimal way. Calculate the number of times he's got to push a button in order to open the lock in the worst-case scenario.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
A single line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of buttons the lock has.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
In a single line print the number of times Manao has to push a button in the worst-case scenario.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
Consider the first test sample. Manao can fail his first push and push the wrong button. In this case he will already be able to guess the right one with his second push. And his third push will push the second right button. Thus, in the worst-case scenario he will only need 3 pushes.

<h1>58A Chat room</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Vasya has recently learned to type and log on to the Internet. He immediately entered a chat room and decided to say hello to everybody. Vasya typed the word s. It is considered that Vasya managed to say hello if several letters can be deleted from the typed word so that it resulted in the word "hello". For example, if Vasya types the word "ahhellllloou", it will be considered that he said hello, and if he types "hlelo", it will be considered that Vasya got misunderstood and he didn't manage to say hello. Determine whether Vasya managed to say hello by the given word s.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first and only line contains the word s, which Vasya typed. This word consisits of small Latin letters, its length is no less that 1 and no more than 100 letters.

<strong>Output</strong><br>
If Vasya managed to say hello, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".

<h1>155A I love %username%</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Vasya adores sport programming. He can't write programs but he loves to watch the contests' progress. Vasya even has a favorite coder and Vasya pays special attention to him.</p>

<p>One day Vasya decided to collect the results of all contests where his favorite coder participated and track the progress of his coolness. For each contest where this coder participated, he wrote out a single non-negative number — the number of points his favorite coder earned in the contest. Vasya wrote out the points for the contest in the order, in which the contests run (naturally, no two contests ran simultaneously).</p>

<p>Vasya considers a coder's performance in a contest amazing in two situations: he can break either his best or his worst performance record. First, it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly more points that he earned on each past contest. Second, it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly less points that he earned on each past contest. A coder's first contest isn't considered amazing. Now he wants to count the number of amazing performances the coder had throughout his whole history of participating in contests. But the list of earned points turned out long and Vasya can't code... That's why he asks you to help him.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of contests where the coder participated.
<br><br>
The next line contains n space-separated non-negative integer numbers — they are the points which the coder has earned. The points are given in the chronological order. All points do not exceed 10000.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the single number — the number of amazing performances the coder has had during his whole history of participating in the contests.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first sample the performances number 2 and 3 are amazing.
<br><br>
In the second sample the performances number 2, 4, 9 and 10 are amazing.

<p>Vasya's birthday is approaching and Lena decided to sew a patterned handkerchief to him as a present. Lena chose digits from 0 to n as the pattern. The digits will form a rhombus. The largest digit n should be located in the centre. The digits should decrease as they approach the edges. For example, for n = 5 the handkerchief pattern should look like that:</p>

<h1>208A Dubstep</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Vasya works as a DJ in the best Berland nightclub, and he often uses dubstep music in his performance. Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them.</p>

<p>Let's assume that a song consists of some number of words. To make the dubstep remix of this song, Vasya inserts a certain number of words "WUB" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including "WUB", in one string and plays the song at the club.</p>

<p>For example, a song with words "I AM X" can transform into a dubstep remix as "WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX" and cannot transform into "WUBWUBIAMWUBX".</p>

<p>Recently, Petya has heard Vasya's new dubstep track, but since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Vasya remixed. Help Petya restore the original song.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't exceed 200 characters. It is guaranteed that before Vasya remixed the song, no word contained substring "WUB" in it; Vasya didn't change the word order. It is also guaranteed that initially the song had at least one word.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the words of the initial song that Vasya used to make a dubsteb remix. Separate the words with a space.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first sample: "WUBWUBABCWUB" = "WUB" + "WUB" + "ABC" + "WUB". That means that the song originally consisted of a single word "ABC", and all words "WUB" were added by Vasya.
<br><br>
In the second sample Vasya added a single word "WUB" between all neighbouring words, in the beginning and in the end, except for words "ARE" and "THE" — between them Vasya added two "WUB".
